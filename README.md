# sales-analysis-pandas
Analysis of sales data from an electronic store made to practice pandas and matplotlib skills. <br>
Based on Keith Galli's tutorial: https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks

In the project I try to answer a few business questions:
1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?


Technologies & versions:
- Python 3.9.6
